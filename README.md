# CNN
Implementation and comparison of a basic version of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in Python

**Dataset:**
- [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
- split in training and test data

**Note:**
- scikit-learn is used to implement the CNN and ANN
- comparison of training and test accuracy between CNN and ANN (plots over time)
- comparison of the number of parameters used for the CNN an ANN
